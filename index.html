						<p>Remember:Me is a journaling website with one goal: Keep it simple. Each entry is stored in a "Day Card" and has a character limit that allows for only 1-2 paragraphs. With a limit, one can focus on making short summary of his/her day and focus on all the important points.<br /><br />
						Keeping the writing to a minimum also allows the reader an easy way of seeing the gist of a day, or a week, a month, or even a year. This site is aimed for those who want to keep a record of their lives, but aren't into writing a whole lot.<br/><br />
						Thanks for reading, please enjoy this concept site!</p>
